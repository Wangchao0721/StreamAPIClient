Android Long Polling StreamAPI Client
===============

###What I want to do:

There is a Streaming API Server to push message , I need a android client with HTTPUrlConnection to set up long-lived 
http connection to receive message.

###What This Project for:

Currently I read that Java doesn't have any built-in support for asynchronous HTTP from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5494994/streaming-data-with-httpurlconnection.
So I turn to set up a long polling http connection with server to receive stream message
